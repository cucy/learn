Protocols
Protocols are a somewhat weird concept within the asyncio module. They are classes that we define that must follow a predefined interface. Interfaces, if you've never encountered them before, act as a kind of contract that ensures that a class is written in such a manner that it meets the contracts criteria.

Again, the concept of protocols lies out of the remit of this chapter, but I'd encourage research into them as they can be excellent modes of transports within your Python programs. The official documentation for both transports and protocols can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html.



协议
协议在asyncio模块中是一个有点奇怪的概念。它们是我们定义的类，必须遵循预定义的接口。接口，如果您以前从未遇到过，可以作为一种契约，以确保该类以满足契约标准的方式编写。

同样，协议的概念不在本章的讨论范围之内，但是我鼓励对它们进行研究，因为它们可以成为您的Python程序中出色的传输模式。传输和协议的官方文档可以在https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html中找到。
